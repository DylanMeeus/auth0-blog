## Spring Boot Overview

Spring Boot is another technology from Pivotal, known for giving us the powerful Spring framework, which features the full power of Spring in an easily accessible framework. With Spring Boot, they offer an easy way to set up a project and get it running in no-time. They took the approach of convention over configuration, meaning that you don't need to spend a lot of time struggling with spring configuration. Together with having an embedded Tomcat, Jetty or undertow, a large part of possible deployment issues have been taken away, causing most applications to 'just run'. 

Above all, Spring Boot is meant to make it *easy* to get a project running, which starts all the way at the beginning, by providing multiple ways to set up a Spring Boot project. Let's jump right into setting up our project and getting our 'Hello World'!
