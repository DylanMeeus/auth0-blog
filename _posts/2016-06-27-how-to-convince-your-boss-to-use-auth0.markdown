Auth0 is an enterprise-grade platform for modern identity. We give you tools that eliminate the friction of authentication for your applications and APIs. Our products increase developer productivity by at least 50 percent while ensuring security is top-notch.


## The Benefits of Using Auth0

There are many benefits to leveraging Auth0 in your software development process.

### 1 - Single Sign On

You can enable Single Sign On for your corporate applications like Salesforce, Dropbox, Slack, and many more! Auth0 provides out-of-the-box support for more than 15 cloud applications. These applications are: Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Box, CloudBees, Concur, Dropbox, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Adobe Echosign, Egnyte, New Relic, Office 365, Salesforce, Sharepoint, Slack, Springcm, Zendesk, and Zoom.

What if your application is not in the list of our pre-integrated apps? No problem! We also support the main industry standards such as SAML, WS-Fed, and OAuth 2.0 so you can hook any third-party application that you need.

Auth0 also provides **Single Log Out**. The ability for you to log out of one of your applications, hence logging you out in all of them.

### 2 -  Social Login

There are so many platforms currently that requires some form of registration to have access to. According to a report by [Web Hosting Buzz Survey](http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/blog/2013/03/21/whos-sharing-what/), more than 80 percent of users are bothered about creating new accounts on websites. So, providing social login to your apps will increase the number of registrations on your platform.

Auth0 supports 30+ social providers: Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, Windows Live, LinkedIn, GitHub, PayPal, Amazon, vKontakte, Yandex, 37signals, Box, Salesforce, Salesforce (sandbox), Salesforce Community, Fitbit, Baidu, RenRen, Weibo, AOL, Shopify, WordPress, Dwolla, miiCard, Yammer, SoundCloud, Instagram, The City, The City (sandbox), Planning Center, Evernote, Evernote (sandbox), and Exact. If any of the social platform you need isn't listed here, Auth0 provides the ability to add new custom platforms.

### 3 - Fingerprint Authentication

Users are always faced with the challenge of remembering a number of different passwords, they want the simplest means of secure authentication as possible. One way to combat that challenge is to leverage on the fingerprint sensors that are now prevalent on mobile devices. **Auth0** provides the platform to authenticate users with **TouchID**. When a user signs up to use fingerprint authentication, Auth0 generates a key-pair, creates the user and stores the private key on the device.

### 4 - Multi-factor authentication

Several applications suffer different level of authentication attacks. One way to eradicate such attacks is to require users to present more than one piece of identifying information. **Auth0** multi-factor authentication is a method of verifying users which requires them to provide more than just username and password. It provides a second layer of security to user log-ins and transactions.

Why use Auth0 Multi-factor Authentication?

* **Easy to use** - Auth0 Multi-factor Authentication is simple to setup and use. Find out more [here](https://auth0.com/docs/multifactor-authentication)
* **Scalable** - Auth0 Multi-factor Authentication harnesses the power of the cloud, hence supporting high volume critical scenarios
* **Always protected** - Auth0 Multi-Factor Authentication provides strong authentication using the highest industry standards
* **Reliable** - 99.98% uptime guarantee of Auth0 Multi-factor Authentication

**Auth0** provides [2-Factor Authentication](https://auth0.com/learn/two-factor-authentication/) with **Google Authenticator** and **Duo** out of the box.

### 5 - Passwordless Authentication

Passwordless Authentication allows users to login without the need to remember a password. This improves user experience greatly since users will only need an email address or phone number to register for your application. It cuts down registration time by half, thus allowing more users to easily register on your application/platform. With **Auth0**, you can set up passwordless authentication on Single Page Apps, Regular Web Apps, iOs and Android Apps. **Auth0** provides various options for achieving passwordless connections as shown below:

You can read more about **Auth0** secure passwordless connections [here](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/passwordless).

### 6 - Serverless

Serverless is a new cloud computing trend that changes the way applications are being built and maintained. Serverless ensures you focus on code, not servers. Traditionally, a software engineer has to write code, spin up servers, ensure the servers are communicating with each other effectively and also be concerned with code deployment to the servers.

**Auth0** provides the ability for software engineers to solely focus on code and business logic with [webtask](https://webtask.io/) without bothering about the server infrastructure.

At **Auth0**, we focus on running, provisioning, maintaining and scaling the general infrastructure for you while you think up ideas and write code. We have been using webtasks to support [platform extensibility through custom code](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/10/07/extensibility-through-code-using-webtasks/). Webtasks allow us to execute untrusted code with very low latency in a secure way, which is the foundation of a key customization feature we offer our customers. We like to think about webtasks as a much more developer friendly alternative compared to other vendors, and one that offers great flexibility thanks to high fidelity to HTTP. You can use webtasks in a variety of applications, from sandboxing untrusted code, to creating API gateways, lightweight HTML applications, or API backends for mobile apps.

With **Auth0 webtask**, A developer only pays for the actual time functions are run in the codebase. Check out a sample app built using webtask [here](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/12/11/get-your-twitter-share-count-back-with-a-webtask/).

You can start experimenting with **webtasks** by creating a free Auth0 account below, or head directly to [webtask.io](https://webtask.io).

### 7 - Technical Support

**Auth0** provides [libraries](https://github.com/auth0/) and [docs](https://auth0.com/docs) that enables developers to set up Authentication and Authorization in their apps within minutes. We support client-platforms: Vanilla JS, React, EmberJS and AngularJS, server-platforms: PHP, Nodejs, Ruby, Golang, Java, Python, .NET, Laravel, Wordpress, Joomla, Sharepoint and mobile-platforms: Android, iOs-objc.
